# Introduction 
TODO: This project is supposed to  retireve Tweets data and process it into insights in order to specify and filter specific tweets corresponding to the implemented (structured) insights. The user through this project should be able to identify the insights' details.

# Getting Started
TODO: Guide for the Web Application:
1.	The user is expected to access the website through the link "localhost:5555:IRProject/"
2.	The application contsists of 3 main usecases that the user will be able to procceed through:
    * Geographic Location: The user will be expected to set through a map the Geographic points to retrieve tweets in the selected area.
    * Time Interval: The user will be expected to detect the time-span of the tweets that they need to retrieve.
    * Search Specifications: The user will be expected to enter a word or a sentence in order to check whether it exists in the content of the tweet.
3. The application is built through the agile software engineering method, meaning that there will be different releases regarding the content of the application:	
    * Version 1:
        1. Gneerating the map, the time intervals in the front end.
        2. Generating restFUL APIs to match with the system's front end.
        3. Applying ElasticSearch for queries' content.
    * Version 1.1 (final):
        1. Generating more insights for more user specifications.
        2. Generating the backend of the new insights.
